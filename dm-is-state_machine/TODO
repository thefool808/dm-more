TODO
====

* Take a look at using DataMapper's Enum type.
  - Does the Enum type support for all databases?  (SQLite?)


* I am not real happy with spec/unit/dsl:
  - The specs are brittle.
  - The specs don't actually test much.

  However, the integration specs are pretty thorough.  Maybe each
  serves their own purpose.


API QUESTIONS
=============

* Some people are asking for convenience methods.

  For example, instead of:
    light = TrafficLight.new
    light.color == "yellow"

  We could possibly offer:
    light.yellow?

  Advantages:
    - More compact syntax.

  Disadvantages:
    - Namespace pollution
    - Possible namespace collision if you have more than one state machine
      in your model.


* Should skipping to a new state automatically trigger the :enter event?


* Should we add loopback checking?

  In other words, if there is a transition defined from one state back to
  the same state, should the :enter and :exit events fire?


* Should we add support for DataMapper callbacks? (e.g. after saving)


SOMEDAY / MAYBE
===============

* Consider trying out a nested state machine.
