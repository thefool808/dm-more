* Added functionality and docs

  - Added support to pass a symbol to a transition, which will call the
    corresponding method.  This means you don't have to put a whole
    Proc inside the state machine definition if you don't want to.
  - Added support for the :exit transition.
  - Created a new example called SlotMachine in /spec/integration
  - Updated README and TODO.
